### [Seeking Help](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/03-seeking-help/index.html)

::: callout-tip
## Key Points

Use `help()` or `?` to get help in R.
:::

#### Challenge 1

Look at the help page for `c`. What kind of vector do you expect will be created if you evaluate the following?

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3)
c('d', 'e', 'f')
c(1, 2, 'f')
```

<!-- Challenge 1 answer begin -->

\> c(1, 2, 3)

\[1\] 1 2 3 This results in an integer vector

\> c('d', 'e', 'f')

\[1\] "d" "e" "f" This results in a character vector

\> c(1, 2, 'f')

\[1\] "1" "2" "f" This results in a character vector

<!-- Challenge 1 answer end -->

#### Challenge 2

Look at the help for the `paste` function. You will need to use it later. What's the difference between the `sep` and `collapse` arguments?

<!-- Challenge 2 answer begin -->

sep uses a character to determine how each term is separated in the paste function result. collapse is an optional character to determine how results are separated in the paste function result.

<!-- Challenge 2 answer end -->

#### Challenge 3

Use help to find a function (and its associated parameters) that you could use to load data from a tabular file in which columns are delimited with "\t\" (tab) and the decimal point is a"." (period). This check for decimal separator is important, especially if you are working with international colleagues, because different countries have different conventions for the decimal point (i.e. comma vs period).

# Hint

Use `??"read table"` to look up functions related to reading in tabular data.

<!-- Challenge 3 answer begin -->

```         
read.delim(file, header = TRUE, sep = "\t", quote = "\"",
           dec = ".", fill = TRUE, comment.char = "", ...)
```
